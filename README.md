# React Authentication Routing

This is a simple React project demonstrating authentication routing using static username and password (`admin`/`admin`) to redirect users to a dashboard.

## Features

- **Login Page**: A login page where users enter their username and password.
- **Dashboard Page**: A protected page that users can only access if they provide the correct credentials.
- **Authentication Context**: Implements `AuthContext` to manage authentication state globally.
- **Bootstrap Integration**: The UI is styled using Bootstrap for a clean and responsive design.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (https://nodejs.org)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
