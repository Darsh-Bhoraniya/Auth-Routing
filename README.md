# AuthRouting

This project demonstrates authentication-based routing in a React application. It uses a static username and password (`admin/admin`) to authenticate users and grant access to a protected dashboard. The project is built with React, React Router, and Bootstrap for responsive design.

## Features

- **Login Page**: A secure login page where users can authenticate using their credentials.
- **Protected Dashboard**: A dashboard accessible only to authenticated users with correct credentials.
- **Authentication Context**: Uses `AuthContext` to manage and maintain the user's authentication state globally.
- **Routing Security**: Prevents unauthorized access to the dashboard by redirecting unauthenticated users.
- **Bootstrap UI**: Modern, responsive styling provided by Bootstrap.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages for invalid login attempts.
